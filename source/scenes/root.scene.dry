This is a game of alternate history and future. While historical accuracy is a concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

For more information on the politics and government of the Third Polish Republic, see the "Library" page on the top left. If this is your first time playing the game, it is strongly recommended that you read at least some of this information.
